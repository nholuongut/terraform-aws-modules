This repository contains common solutions for AWS users implemented as standalone and reusable Terraform modules.

## Prerequisites

Download Terraform here. Each download is simply a zip file with a compiled executable enclosed. Extract that executable to the location of your choice and make sure its permissions are right (e.g. chmod 755). Good locations include /usr/local/bin, ~/bin, or %userprofile%/bin if you're a Windows user. Be sure to add this folder to your PATH. For Windows users, you can change your path in the Control Panel, under User Accounts. Choose your own Windows account and choose "Change my environment variables." Edit your PATH variable and add ";%USERPROFILE%\bin" to the end of it (including the semicolon).

You will need an AWS account, or a VMware vSphere account*, or both. You can sign up for a free AWS account here, and you'll get a year's worth of free-tier access to AWS services. BE AWARE that AWS free-tier has limits. These demos will cost money if you leave the resources that Terraform creates running. However, with judicious use of your free-tier access, it's quite possible to learn a lot about the AWS platform over the course of one year.

You don't need Git, but you should use it. You can download that here.

If you're setting up an AWS account (or you already have one), then you should be sure that the computer you're working on has your AWS credentials configured. Check out this guide on how to configure your access and secret keys to the AWS API.

In order for Terraform to work, you will need these variables set, or an AWS credentials file (The default location is $HOME/.aws/credentials on Linux and OS X, or "%USERPROFILE%.aws\credentials" for Windows users):

* $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="anaccesskey"
* $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="asecretkey"
* $ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"

## Getting Started

Near the top of this page, you'll see a green button that says "clone or download." Click on that, and then choose to download a zip of the repository. Or, if you installed Git, you can clone it:

git clone https://github.com/nholuongut/terraform-demo.git
In either case, wherever you clone or download your copy of the repository doesn't matter. Just make sure it's in a place you'll be able to find later.

# Go Forth!

Infrastructure as code is a powerful concept. Tracking infrastructure as code reduces mistakes, encourages peer review, and shortens delivery cycles. Even if you have to spend a week cutting your teeth on your first Terraform state, spin it up and destroy it a dozen times. You'll be amazed at what you can do with Terraform and other tools like Packer and Ansible once you get your first project working.
